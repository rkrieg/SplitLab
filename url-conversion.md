# URL Conversion (`url_reached`) — Same-Domain Cases

How SplitLab's Conversion URL feature works, and which same-domain scenarios are supported. Verified against the code.

## How it works

A conversion goal of type `url_reached` stores a `url_pattern` (e.g. `/thanks`, `/booking`) in the `conversion_goals` table. A conversion fires when the visitor reaches a URL matching that pattern (case-insensitive regex, tested against both full `href` and `pathname + search`).

Two independent mechanisms check URL goals — **they do not share storage**:

| Mechanism | Where it runs | localStorage key | Cross-test aware? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Injected snippet (`src/lib/tracking.ts`) | SplitLab-served HTML pages (custom domain) | `sl_ctx` (per-test map) | Yes — `checkStoredUrlGoals()` fires other tests' saved goals |
| tracker.js (`src/app/tracker.js/route.ts`) | Client's own site (site-wide install) | `sl_tracking` (per-test map since the `url-conversion-v2` fix; old single-slot values auto-migrate) | Yes — `checkStoredUrlGoals()` fires other stored tests' URL goals; still never reads `sl_ctx` |

Key structural fact: on a custom domain, **every path** is rewritten by middleware to `/api/serve`, which only serves active tests. Any path without an active test returns 404 — there are no "plain pages" on a SplitLab custom domain.

## Working cases ✅

1. **HTML variant, SPA navigation** — pushState/replaceState/popstate/hashchange to `/thanks` within the same page; the snippet wraps history and re-checks its own URL goals.
2. **HTML variant → another SplitLab-served test page on the same custom domain** — test A's snippet saves context to `sl_ctx`; the destination page's snippet runs `checkStoredUrlGoals()` and fires test A's conversion with correct variant/visitor attribution (e.g. `/offer` → `/booking`).
3. **Redirect variant (proxy mode OFF) → client's real domain with tracker.js installed site-wide** — tracker.js resolves `?sl_vid` via `/api/resolve`, stores context in `sl_tracking`; when the visitor reaches `/thanks` on that same origin, tracker.js boots from localStorage and fires the goal. Requires **same origin** (www vs naked domain / subdomains break localStorage sharing).
4. **Dashboard preview URLs** — the catch-all route (`/[slug]/[testId]/[...rest]`) keeps trailing segments in the browser URL so patterns like `/booking` match (note: Open-button previews with `sl_vh` inject no tracking snippet, so no events fire).
5. **Chained redirect variants on the same client domain** — **FIXED on `url-conversion-v2`**: `sl_tracking` is now a per-test map; each stored test's URL goals are checked on every page, attributed to that test's own variant/visitor. Old single-slot values migrate automatically on the visitor's next page load. *(Was not-working; see detailed explanation below.)*

## Not working cases ❌

1. **Cross-origin navigation** — HTML variant linking out to the client's real site: the custom domain's localStorage isn't visible there, and `sl_vid` isn't appended to outbound links on this branch. *(A fix exists on an unmerged branch — see detailed explanation below.)*

## Partly working — proxy mode (iframe), depends on the browser ⚠️

Earlier drafts listed proxy mode as flatly not-working. That is **too pessimistic** given tracker.js is **mandatory** in every client's own source code. Re-analysed from code below. Note: `proxy_mode` **defaults to ON**.

In proxy mode SplitLab serves a wrapper page from the custom domain containing `<iframe src="destination?sl_vid=…&sl_vh=…">` (`serve/route.ts:234-254`). The wrapper's own injected snippet is useless for `url_reached` — it only ever sees the unchanging wrapper URL. The work is done by **tracker.js running inside the iframe**, on the client's own site:

1. Iframe loads `clientsite.com/offer?sl_vid=X&sl_vh=Y`. Only `sl_vid`+`sl_vh` are passed (no `sl_tid`), so tracker.js takes **Method 2** (`tracker.js:974-1011`): resolves the test + goals via `/api/resolve` and `store()`s context using the passed `sl_vh`.
2. Visitor clicks an internal link `/thanks` (no params) → same-origin full navigation **inside the iframe** → tracker.js reboots, takes **Method 4** `load()` (`tracker.js:1037-1038`), reads the stored context, matches `/thanks`, and fires the conversion to `/api/event`. The wrapper's cross-origin blindness never matters — the tracker is *inside* the box, reading its own URL.

**Why "partly":** the iframe is a third-party frame, so its `localStorage` is **partitioned** — but partitioned ≠ broken. The bucket is keyed to the top-level site (the custom domain), which never changes in proxy mode, so it stays **stable across every internal navigation**. The real variable is whether the browser *grants* storage to a third-party iframe at all:

| Case | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Proxy → client's **own multi-page** site, Chrome / Firefox | **Should work** — partition is stable across internal nav |
| Proxy → client's own site, **Safari ITP** | **Fragile** — Safari may deny third-party-iframe `localStorage` without the Storage Access API |
| Proxy, iframe navigates to a **different** origin (clientsite → calendly) | **Broken** — new partition, no context (genuine cross-domain) |
| Proxy → pure **third-party** destination (Calendly) with no tracker | **Impossible** — sealed cross-origin iframe, nothing to read the params |

**Status: code-level analysis only — NOT yet live-tested** (unlike the redirect-mode cases below, which were verified on dev). The Safari question in particular can only be settled by a live test. Potential hardening if live testing shows gaps: invoke the Storage Access API inside the iframe, or add a `postMessage` bridge so the iframe reports conversions to the wrapper.

## Missed conversions — detailed explanations

### Chained redirect variants overwrite each other (FIXED on `url-conversion-v2`)

tracker.js on the client's site remembers "which test is this visitor in" using a **single localStorage slot** (`sl_tracking`). It can only hold **one test's context at a time** — think of it as a whiteboard with room for one instruction.

Example, client site `acme.com` with tracker.js site-wide and two active tests:

- **Test A**: redirect variant → `acme.com/summer-sale`, goal = reach `/thanks`
- **Test B**: redirect variant → `acme.com/pricing`, goal = reach `/signup-done`

1. Visitor hits Test A → 302 to `acme.com/summer-sale?sl_vid=A123`. tracker.js resolves it and stores: *"Test A — watch for /thanks."*
2. Same visitor later enters Test B's flow → lands on `acme.com/pricing?sl_vid=B456`. tracker.js **erases the slot** and stores: *"Test B — watch for /signup-done."* Test A's context is gone.
3. Visitor reaches `acme.com/thanks` — exactly Test A's goal. tracker.js only knows about `/signup-done`, so it does nothing. **Test A's conversion is silently missed.**

Nothing errors — the second test just wipes the first test's memory. With only one test in play per visitor per domain, this never triggers. The inline snippet on SplitLab-hosted pages never had this bug (its `sl_ctx` store is a per-test map); only tracker.js did.

**The fix (implemented on `url-conversion-v2`, 2026-07-15):** `sl_tracking` is now a per-test map `{ [testId]: { vid, vh, ts, goals } }`, mirroring the snippet's `sl_ctx`:

- `store()` writes `m[testId] = ctx` instead of replacing the key; `load()` returns the most-recent entry as the current test (preserves old attribution behavior for forms/leads).
- Old flat single-slot values migrate to the map on the visitor's next page load, before any validation — returning visitors keep their context.
- `checkStoredUrlGoals()` checks all OTHER stored tests' `url_reached` goals on every page load and SPA navigation, sending each conversion with that test's own stored variant/visitor. Skips the current test (its own `checkUrlGoals()` covers it — no double-fire) and skips scan mode.
- Entries expire after 90 days (matches `sl_visitor` cookie); dedup is in-memory per page-load only, so raw goal-hit counts are unchanged.

**Verification (both passed):**

1. *Simulation* — the emitted tracker script was executed in a stubbed browser (shared in-memory localStorage across page loads, fake `/api/resolve`, sendBeacon capture): chained A→B→`/thanks` credits Test A correctly, shared-goal-URL credits both tests, and single-test flows / old-format migration / TTL pruning / scan mode / `__SL_SNIPPET__` stand-down all behave exactly as before.
2. *Live on dev (2026-07-15)* — two redirect-mode tests on `dev.trysplitlab.com` pointing at `www.hunbalsiddiqui.com` (test pages in `test-pages/`): Test A → `/offer-a.html`, goal `/thanks`; Test B → `/offer-b.html`, goal `/signup-done`. One visitor entered Test A, then Test B without converting — `sl_tracking` held **both** entries (old code would have dropped Test A's here). Reaching `/thanks.html` fired a conversion with **Test A's** testId/variantId/goalId; reaching `/signup-done.html` fired **Test B's**. Both accepted with 200 and showed correctly in analytics.

Expect conversion counts to **rise** after deploy — previously-lost conversions are now recorded.

Code: `saveMap()` / `loadMap()` / `store()` / `load()` / `checkStoredUrlGoals()` in `src/app/tracker.js/route.ts`.

### Cross-origin jump loses context (not-working case 3) — fix exists but unmerged

Test runs on custom domain `try.acme.com/offer` (served by SplitLab, snippet injected), goal = reach `/thanks`. The page links "Book now" → `acme.com/booking`, the client's **real** site on a different domain.

1. On `try.acme.com/offer` the snippet saves the test context into **`try.acme.com`'s** localStorage.
2. Visitor clicks through to `acme.com/booking`. Browsers isolate localStorage per origin, so nothing saved on `try.acme.com` is visible on `acme.com`.
3. tracker.js on `acme.com` finds no `?sl_vid` in the URL and an empty localStorage → concludes the visitor is in no test and goes idle.
4. Visitor reaches `acme.com/thanks` — **no conversion recorded.**

**Status:** a fix was already built on branch **`conversion-url-fixes`** (2026-07-13) but was **never merged** into `development` or `main`:

- `7b4fb22` — tracker.js auto-decorates outbound links, forms, and `window.open` with sl params (redirect mode)
- `c55de6f` — adds the same cross-domain linker to the inline HTML-page snippet

Until that branch is merged, the code on `development` still carries the "not implemented yet" comment (`src/lib/tracking.ts:72-75`) and this case remains broken. Merging `conversion-url-fixes` turns it into a working case.

## Cross-domain edge cases (from the `conversion-url-fixes` branch)

The `conversion-url-fixes` branch adds a GA4-style cross-domain linker: when the visitor navigates to a different domain, the tracking context (`sl_tid`/`sl_vid`/`sl_vh`) is appended to the destination URL. tracker.js on the destination rebuilds context from those params (detect Method 1, now also fetching goals via `/api/resolve` so `url_reached` patterns can fire there) and strips them from the URL. Implemented in **both** modes:

- **Redirect mode** — tracker.js on the client's site (`7b4fb22`)
- **HTML mode** — the inline snippet on SplitLab-hosted pages (`c55de6f`)

### Covered navigations ✅

1. **Link clicks** (`<a href>`), including new-tab opens — decorated on `mousedown`, `auxclick` (middle-click), and `click` in capture phase, so every click variant is caught before the browser follows the link.
2. **Form submits to another domain** — POST forms get a decorated `action`; GET forms get hidden `sl_tid`/`sl_vid`/`sl_vh` inputs instead (a GET submit replaces the action's query string with form fields, so query params alone would be dropped). Reads `action` via `getAttribute` so an input named "action" can't shadow it.
3. **`window.open(url)`** — `window.open` is monkey-patched to decorate the URL first.

Safety rails in `decorate()`: only `http:`/`https:` URLs, same-hostname URLs skipped (localStorage already covers those), and URLs that already carry `sl_vid`/`sl_tid` are left alone (no double-decoration).

### NOT covered ❌

1. **JS-driven redirects via `window.location.href = url`** (also `location.assign()` / `location.replace()`) — the `location` object cannot be intercepted or monkey-patched by any script, so these navigations leave undecorated. The planned solution is a manual escape hatch in tracker.js — `SplitLab.go(url)` (which does `window.location.href = decorate(url)`) plus a public `SplitLab.decorate(url)` — the page's own JS calls it instead of setting `location.href` directly, the same way GA handles this. **The code for this already exists in `7b4fb22` but is commented out/disabled** — it needs to be enabled (and possibly complemented by the Navigation API where supported) as part of v2.
2. **PROXY mode — see the dedicated "Partly working — proxy mode" section above.** None of the *linker* work applies inside the iframe. But for the client's **own** multi-page site (tracker.js mandatory), conversions can still fire via tracker.js *inside* the iframe reading its own same-origin URL — code-level working, browser-dependent (Safari fragile). Genuinely unsolved only when the iframe navigates to a **different** origin, or the destination is pure third-party with no tracker.
3. Other undecoratable navigation paths (same root cause as #1): `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`, server-side redirects from the destination page, and navigations triggered inside third-party widgets.

### Status

Both linker commits live only on `conversion-url-fixes` — not yet merged into `development`, `main`, or `url-conversion-v2`. V2 work: merge the linker, enable `SplitLab.go(url)` / `SplitLab.decorate(url)`, and design a solution for proxy mode.

## Missing cross-domain edge cases (v2 checklist)

Same-domain cases above are verified; cross-domain has only been code-reviewed, not tested. Based on what the linker actually handles, these are the open gaps.

### Not handled at all

1. **JS redirects** — `window.location.href` / `location.assign()` / `location.replace()` cannot be intercepted by any script. The `SplitLab.go(url)` / `SplitLab.decorate(url)` escape hatch exists in `7b4fb22` but is **commented out**; enable it and document it for clients.
2. **Proxy mode — reclassified; see "Partly working — proxy mode" above.** The linker doesn't touch the iframe, but tracker.js inside the iframe handles the client's own same-origin pages (code-level working, Safari-fragile, not yet live-tested). Still unsolved for iframe→different-origin hops and pure third-party destinations.
3. **Meta-refresh and server-side redirects** on the destination — `sl_*` params survive only if the redirect forwards the query string, which most don't.
4. **Destination domain without tracker.js** — decoration is useless if nothing on the destination reads the params. Every cross-domain hop requires tracker.js installed there; no fallback exists.
5. **Third-party embedded widgets** (Calendly/Typeform iframes on the destination page) — the conversion happens inside a cross-origin iframe and never surfaces as a URL on the destination domain, so `url_reached` can't see it.

### Handled in code but never tested

6. **Chained cross-domain context overwrite** — the single-slot `sl_tracking` bug is reachable cross-domain too: arrive on domain B with Test A's params, later arrive with Test B's params → Test A's context erased on B.
7. **Destination strips unknown query params** — routers/canonical redirects may drop `sl_*` before tracker.js runs; context silently lost.
8. **GET-form hidden inputs** — verify the destination's tracker picks up `sl_tid`/`sl_vid`/`sl_vh` submitted as form fields, and that they don't pollute the site's own form processing.
9. **Shadow DOM links** — `e.target.closest('a[href]')` may not reach anchors inside shadow roots (event retargeting); links in web components could go undecorated.
10. **Copy-link / drag-to-tab** — copying a link via context menu doesn't navigate, so the copied href is undecorated; pasted in a new tab, context is lost. Minor but real.
11. **Safari ITP** — script-written localStorage is capped at ~7 days in Safari; the 90-day context TTL silently shrinks, so late conversions on the destination are lost there.
12. **Pageview attribution after a decorated hop** — detect Method 1 fires a `pageview` for the origin test from the destination domain; per visitor/test/day dedup should keep counts sane, but the analytics implications haven't been checked.
13. **`www` vs naked domain** — `decorate()` treats different hostnames as cross-domain, which incidentally fixes the www/naked localStorage split; behavior never explicitly tested.
